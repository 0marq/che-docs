= Enabling self-registration

For {prod-short} installed without OpenShift OAuth support, self-registration of users is disabled by default, therefore the option to register a new user is not available on the login page. 

[NOTE]
====
Users can self-register in {prod} only if they have been added to the cluster by the administrator first.
====

.Procedure

To enable self-registration of users:

. Navigate to the *Realm Settings* menu on the left and open the *Login* tab. 

. Set *User registration* option to *On*.
