. Get host and port for connecting to Workspace Agent Tomcat. This depends on the infrastructure:
+
** *Docker:* Use a port of your host that is mapped to a container port. It can be found in Workspace Servers of running workspace:

+
** *Local OKD:* Use the following command to retrieve a cluster IP to use as a host (replace `wsId` with the ID of your workspace):
+
----
$ oc get service -l=che.workspace_id=wsId -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.clusterIP}'`
----
+
Use the same port as was defined in Workspace Server for JPDA.
+
** *Remote OKD:* This option is currently not supported.
