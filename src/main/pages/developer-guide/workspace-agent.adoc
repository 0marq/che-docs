== Enabling Debug on WS agent

To enable debugging on Che WS Agent, edit it's Workspace environment settings:

- `WSAGENT_DEBUG` - set true to enable JPDA mode for WS Aagent Tomcat, `false` by default;
- `WSAGENT_DEBUG_PORT` - configure JPDA port, 4403 by default;
- `WSAGENT_DEBUG_SUSPEND` - set `y` to enable JPDA suspend mode, `n` by default.

Note that to access your JPDA port, it has to be declared as a Workspace link:servers.html[Server].

on Docker infrastructure, use `CHE_HOST` host and exposed port of Workspace container to connect to with your debugger.
