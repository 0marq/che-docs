== Enabling Debug on WS agent

1) Configure your WS Agent Tomcat JPDA launching parameters with following Workspace environment variables:

- `WSAGENT_DEBUG` - set true to enable JPDA mode for WS Aagent Tomcat, `false` by default;
- `WSAGENT_DEBUG_PORT` - configure JPDA port, 4403 by default;
- `WSAGENT_DEBUG_SUSPEND` - set `y` to enable JPDA suspend mode, `n` by default.

3) Get host and port for connecting to WS Agent Tomcat. This depends on the infrastructure:

Local OKD:

Use following command to retrieve cluster IP to use as a host (replace `wsId` with ID of your workspace):

`oc get service -l=che.workspace_id=wsId -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.clusterIP}'`

Use same port as was defined in Workspace Server for JPDA.

* Remote OKD:
