A Factory is a template containing configuration to automate generating new Workspace with factory identifier added to IDE URL. Factories can be used to create replicas of existing workspaces or to automate the provisioning of statically or dynamically defined workspaces.

[id="try-a-factory"]
== Try a Factory

Clone a public workspace on `che.openshift.io` by clicking https://che.openshift.io/f?id=factorymtyoro1y0qt8tq2[try a factory].

[id="using-factories"]
== Using Factories

Factories can be invoked from a Factory URL built in multiple ways. You can replace the `localhost:8080` domain with the hostname of any Che installation.

Using Factories on `che.openshift.io` require the user to be authenticated. Users who are not authenticated will be presented a login screen after they click on the Factory URL. Users without an account can create one using the same dialog.

 http://localhost:8080/f?url=https://gitlab.com/benoitf/simple-project
|===

Once the Factory is executed, it either loads an existing workspace or generates a new one, depending upon the Factory configuration. The name of the workspace is determined within the Factory configuration and its name becomes part of the URL access with the format `{hostname}/{username}/{workspace}`.
