[id="creating-workspaces"]
== Creating workspaces

Use the ready-to-go link:stacks.html[stacks] in the user's *Dashboard* to create a workspace. Images and configuration in these stacks are certified both for Docker and OpenShift. These stacks are used in daily functional testing.

=== Duplicating an existing stack

Create a stack and then use the resulting stack to create a workspace.

=== Creating a custom stack from a custom recipe

Author a custom link:recipes.html[recipe] and then create a stack. Use the resulting stack to create a workspace.

[id="starting-workspaces"]
== Starting workspaces

You can start a workspace in one of the following ways:

* The workspace starts automatically after it is created in the user's *Dashboard*.

* In the user's *Dashboard*, use the *Run* or *Open* buttons in the *Workspace Details* view.

* Click a workspace name from the recent workspaces displayed in the left panel.

* Use the REST API. For more information about the REST API, see link:rest-api.html[REST API].

The workspace may take time to start depending on factors like network conditions, Docker image availability, configured installers attempting to install additional tools and software in the runtime. Track the progress of the workspace start operation in the *Workspace Start* tab. The tabs for each machine in the workspace environment, stream logs from the installers (terminal, exec agent, ws agent, language servers if any).

[id="managing-a-workspace"]
== Managing a workspace

After a workspace is created or started, you can modify it by adding projects, installers, environment variables, or volumes. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
To edit a raw workspace configuration, take a backup of the working configuration to avoid breaking your workspace. 
====

If you change the configuration of a running workspace and save it, the workspace is restarted. To learn more about workspace configuration, see:

* link:projects.html[Creating projects in workspaces]

* link:installers.html[Installers]

* link:env-variables.html[Environment variables]

* link:volumes.html[Volumes]
