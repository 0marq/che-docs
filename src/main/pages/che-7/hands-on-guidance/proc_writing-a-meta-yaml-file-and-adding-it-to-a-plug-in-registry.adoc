// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// publishing-a-vs-code-extension-into-the-che-plug-in-registry

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_proc_writing-a-meta-yaml-file-and-adding-it-to-a-plug-in-registry.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Writing a meta.yaml file and adding it to a plug-in registry

The plug-in meta information is required to publish a VS Code extension in an Eclipse Che plug-in registry. This meta information is provided as a `meta.yaml` file. To create a `meta.yaml` file for your extension, see the following instructions.

[Discrete]
== Procedure

. Create a `meta.yaml` file in the following plug-in registry directory:
`<apiVersion>/plugins/<publisher>/<pluginName>/<pluginVersion>/`
+
//NOTE: Support of two or more extensions is broken. See the link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/13578[GitHub description for this issue] for further information.

. Edit the `meta.yaml` and provide the necessary information. The configuration file must adhere to the following structure:
