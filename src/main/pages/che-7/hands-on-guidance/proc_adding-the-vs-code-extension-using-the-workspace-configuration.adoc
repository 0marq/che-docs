// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// adding-che-plug-in-registry-vs-code-extension-to-a-workspace

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_adding-the-vs-code-extension-using-the-workspace-configuration.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

. Click the *devfile* tab.

. Locate the *components* section and add a new entry with the following structure:
+
```

   id: link to the `meta.yaml` in your registry, e.g. `https://my-plugin-registry/v3/plugins/<publisher>/<pluginName>/<pluginVersion>/meta.yaml`
