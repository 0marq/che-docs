// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// che-workspace-components

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_user-runtimes.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

Any non-terminating user container can be used as a user runtime. An application that can be defined as a container image or as a set of Kubernetes or OpenShift resource can be included in a Che workspace. This makes it easy to test applications in the Che workspace. To test an application in the Che workspace,  include the application yaml definition used in stage or production in the workspace specification. It is a 12-Factor App Dev/prod parity.

Examples of user runtime are NodeJS, SpringBoot or MongoDB, and MySQL.
