// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// che-workspaces

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_che-workspace-creation-flow.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

A Che workspace is created in the following way:

. A user starts a Che workspace defined by:
* An editor (the default is che-theia)
* A list of plug-ins (example java and kubernetes tooling)
* A list of runtime applications
. *wsmaster* retrieves the editor and plug-in metadata from the plug-in registry.
. For every plug-in type, the *wsmaster* starts a specific plug-in broker.
. The Che plug-in broker transforms the plug-in metadata into a Che plug-in definition. It executes the following steps:
* Downloads a plug-in and extracts its content.
* Processes the plug-in *meta.yaml* file and sends it back to *wsmaster* in the format of a Che plug-in.
. *wsmaster* starts the editor and the plug-in sidecars.
. The editor loads the plug-ins from the plug-in persistent volume.
