This is a hands-on article that shows how to add a Kubernetes application in a Che workspace.

As an example for the article we are going to use a sample Kubernetes applications that has two pods:

* A NodeJS application specified by this link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/devfile/master/samples/web-nodejs-with-db-sample/nodejs-app.yaml[yaml]
* A mongo DB pod specified by this link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/devfile/master/samples/web-nodejs-with-db-sample/mongo-db.yaml[yaml]

To run it on a Kubernetes cluster:

```
node=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/devfile/master/samples/web-nodejs-with-db-sample/nodejs-app.yaml && \
mongo=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/devfile/master/samples/web-nodejs-with-db-sample/mongo-db.yaml && \
kubectl apply -f ${mongo} && \
kubectl apply -f ${node}
```

In the following sections will see how to deploy a new instance of this application in a Che workspace in 3 different scenarios:

* Starting from scratch -> writing a new devfile
* Modifying an existing workspace -> using the dashboard UI
* From a running application-> generating a devfile with `chectl`
