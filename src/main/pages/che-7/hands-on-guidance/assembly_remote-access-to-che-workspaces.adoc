This document describes how to remotely access Che workspaces outside of the browser.

Che workspaces exist as a container and are by default modified from a browser window. Apart from this, there are the following methods of interacting with a Che workspace:

* Opening a command line using the kubernetes command-line tool `kubectl`
* Uploading and downloading files with the `kubectl` tool
