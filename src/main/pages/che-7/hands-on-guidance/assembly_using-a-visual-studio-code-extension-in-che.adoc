Starting with Eclipse Che 7, VisualStudio Code extensions can be installed to extend the functionality of a Che workspace. VS Code extension can run in the Che editor container, or they can be packaged in their own isolated and pre-configured containers with their prerequisites.

This document describes the usage of the VS Code extension in Che with workspaces Che Plugins panel and how you can publish the VS Code extension in a plug-in registry.  By doing so, you can share the extension with other Che users. Note that the extension hosting sidecar container and the use of the extension in a devfile are optional for this.

In addition, you can review the compatibility of the VS Code extensions so that you can be informed whether a specific API is supported or has not been implemented yet.
// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.
