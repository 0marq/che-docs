= Adding a Kubernetes application to an existing workspace using the Dashboard

To modify an existing workspace and add the Kubernetes application using the newly created devfile, see below.

When a user creates a Che workspace he will be able to manage it then by selecting the *Workspaces* menu and clicking on the configuration cog.

The configuration panel has multiple tabs and one of those is the *Devfile* editor. Here the workspace details are represented in the devfile format and can be modified by the user.

Itâ€™s possible to add a Kubernetes component using the *Devfile* editor on the dashboard following the same steps seen in the paragraph above.

For the changes to be taken into account the devfile should be saved and the Che workspace restarted.
