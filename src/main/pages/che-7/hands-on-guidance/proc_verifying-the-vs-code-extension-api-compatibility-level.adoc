// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// using-a-visual-studio-code-extension-in-che

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_verifying-the-vs-code-extension-api-compatibility-level.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Verifying the VS Code extension API compatibility level

Theia does not fully support the VS Code extensions API as yet. The link:https://github.com/che-incubator/vscode-theia-comparator/[vscode-theia-comparator] is used to analyze the compatibility between Che Theia plug-in API and the VS Code extension API. This tool runs in a nightly cycle and the results are published at the link:https://github.com/che-incubator/vscode-theia-comparator/[vscode-theia-comparator] GitHub page.
