// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// che-workspace-configuration

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_persistent-volume-configuration.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Persistent volume configuration

A Kubernetes persistent volume is attached to the Che workspace to persist its data: source code, application logs, tool configurations. A Che server can be configured to use different strategies:

* *common*: A Che workspace that is provisioned in the same Kubernetes namespace, shares the same `PesistentVolume`. The data of different workspaces are separated using subpaths. The default strategy is *common*.

* *unique*: Every Che workspace is attached to a distinct persistent volume. This strategy provides better data isolation but requires more resources.
