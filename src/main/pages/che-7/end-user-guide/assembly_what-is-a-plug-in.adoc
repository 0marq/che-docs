A Che plug-in is an extension of the development environment isolated from the IDE. Plug-ins can be packaged as files or containers to provide their own dependencies.

Extending Eclipse Che using plug-ins can enable the following capabilities:

* *Language support:* Extend the supported languages by relying on the https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/[Language Server Protocol].
* *Debuggers:* Extend debugging capabilities with the https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/[Debug Adapter Protocol].
* *Development Tools:* Integrate your favorite linters, as well as testing and performance tools.
* *Menus, panels, and commands:* Add your own items to the IDE components.
* *Themes:* Build custom themes, extend the UI, or customize icon themes.
* *Snippets, formatters, and syntax highlighting:* Enhance comfort of use with supported programming languages.
* *Keybindings:* Add new keymaps and popular keybindings to make the environment feel natural.
