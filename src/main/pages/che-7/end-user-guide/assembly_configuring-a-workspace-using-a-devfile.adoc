= Configuring a workspace using a devfile

This section describes how to select a workspace, loading in the required stack and a sample project, all in one step.

See the link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile[Devfile specifications] for detailed information on how to add or remove components, or how to set memory and environment variables.


== Importing a project using a devfile

Stacks are defined as link:{site-baseurl}che-7/making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile/[devfiles]. This gives the user more flexibility when defining the projects, IDE, commands, tools, and application runtimes needed in their workspace.

NOTE: In Che 6, a stack is defined with a Dockerfile. In Che 7, `devfile.yaml` is used instead.
