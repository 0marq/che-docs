= Managing your Git Configuration: Your Identity  

The first thing you should do when you start using Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information. 

You need to setup your Git identity in preferences. For this you need to go:

*File* > *Settings* > *Open Prefences*

In the opened window navigate to the Git section, and find
----
 user.name
 user.email
----
and setup your identity.

The same effect will have if you setup your Git identity via executing git config commands in terminal of the Theia container.
You need to open new terminal in the container with Che Theia. To do this open *My Workspace* view and navigate to *Plugins* > *theia-ide..* > *New terminal*  

image::git/terminal-git-command.png[]

and execute next commands:
----
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
----

After that Che Theia will permanently store this information and restore it on next workspace restarts.
