= Managing your Git Configuration: Your Identity  

The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and itâ€™s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

----
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
----

After that we will permanenty store this information and restore it on next workspace restarts.

The same effect will have if you setup your Git identity in preferences. For this you need to go:

*File* > *Settings* > *Open Prefences*

In opened window navigate to the Git section, and find
----
 user.name
 user.email
----
and setup nedded values.
