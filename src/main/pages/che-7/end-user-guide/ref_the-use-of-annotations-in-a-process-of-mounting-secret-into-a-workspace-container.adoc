= The use of annotations in a process of mounting a secret into a workspace container

Kubernetes annotations and labels are tools used by libraries, tools, and other clients, to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to Kubernetes native objects. 

Labels select objects and connect them to a collection that satisfies certain conditions, where annotations are used for non-identifying information that is not used by Kubernetes objects internally.

This section describes Kubernetes annotation values used in the process of Kubernetes secret mounting in a {prod-short} workspace.

Annotations must contain items that help identify the proper mounting configuration. These items are:

* `che.eclipse.org/target-container`: *_Valid till the version {7-14-2-1}_*. The name of the mounting container. If the name is not defined, the secret mounts into all user's containers of the {prod-short} workspace.

* `che.eclipse.org/automount-workspace-secret`: *_Introduced in the version {7-15-2-2}_*. The main mount selector. When set to `true`, the secret mounts into all user's containers of the {prod-short} workspace. When set to `false`, the secret does not mount into containers by default. The value of this attribute can be overridden in devfile components, using the `automountWorkspaceSecrets` boolean property that gives more flexibility to workspace owners. This property requires an `alias` to be defined for the component that uses it.

* `che.eclipse.org/env-name`: The name of the environment variable that is used to mount a secret.

* `che.eclipse.org/mount-as`: This item describes if a secret will be mounted as an environmental variable or a file. Options: `env` or `file`.

* `che.eclipse.org/_<mykeyName>_-env-name: FOO_ENV`: The name of the environment variable used when data contains multiple items. `mykeyName` is used as an example.
