= The use of annotations in a process of mounting a secret into a workspace container

Kubernetes annotations and labels are tools used by libraries, tools, and other clients, to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to Kubernetes native objects. 

Labels select objects and connect them to a collection that satisfies certain conditions, where annotations are used for non-identifying information that is not used by Kubernetes objects internally.

This section describes Kubernetes annotation values used in the process of Kubernetes secret mounting in a {prod-short} workspace.

Annotations must contain items that help identify the proper mounting configuration. These items are:

* `che.eclipse.org/automount-workspace-secret`: Main mount selector.  When set to `true`, the secret mounts into all user's containers of the {prod-short} workspace. When set to `false`,
secret does not mount into containers by default. Value of this attribute can be overridden in defvile components, using `automountWorkspaceSecrets` boolean property, giving more flexibility for workspace owner. Also, this property requires that `alias` must be defined for the component it is used in.
* `che.eclipse.org/env-name`: The name of the environment variable that is used to mount a secret.
* `che.eclipse.org/mount-as`: This item describes if a secret will be mounted as an environmental variable or a file . Options: `env` or `file`
* `che.eclipse.org/_<mykeyName>_-env-name: FOO_ENV`: The name of the environment variable used when data contains multiple items. `mykeyName` is used as an example.
