= Starting a workspace with a devfile

This section describes how to start a Che workspace using your own existing devfile.

.Prerequisites
* A running instance of Eclipse Che. To install an instance of Eclipse Che, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[Che 'quick-starts'].
* An existing workspace defined on this instance of Eclipse Che link:{site-baseurl}che-7/creating-and-configuring-a-new-che-7-workspace/[Creating a workspace from user dashboard].

There are several ways to launch a Che workspace based on a prepared devfile:

== Devfile from Git

Add the devfile to a Git source repository and then create a factory from this repository.

. Put a `devfile.yaml` file in the root of your Git repository.
. Execute the factory by opening the following URL:
+

----
https://__<your-che-host>__/f?url=https://github.com/__<mygroup>__/__<myrepo>__
----

== Devfile from URL

Execute a devfile by constructing the factory with the URL pointing to the raw content of the devfile, for example:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
https://__<your-che-host>__/f?url=https://pastebin.com/raw/ux6iCGaW
----

== Devfile using the `chectl` tool

Execute a workspace from a devfile using the `workspace:start` parameter with the `chectl` tool as follows:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ chectl workspace:start --devfile=devfile.yaml
