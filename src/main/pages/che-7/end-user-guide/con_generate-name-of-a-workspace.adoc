[id="generate-name-of-a-workspace_{context}"]
= Generate name of a workspace

To partially generate name of the workspace, set the `generateName`.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  generateName: che-
----

The workspace name will be in format `<generateName>YYYYY` (e.g. `che-2y7kp`).

There name rules are applied when creating a workspace:

* When `name` is defined, it is used as a workspace name - `<name>`
* When only `generateName` is defined, it is used as a base for generated name - `<generateName>YYYYY`

[NOTE]
====
`Y` is random `[a-z0-9]` character

= Name of a workspace when creating a workspace with Factory

When creating namespace with factory from devfile, the name is always partially generated by these rules:

* When `generateName` is defined, it is used as a base for generated name - `<generateName>YYYYY`.
* When only `name` is defined, it is used as base for generated name - `<name>YYYYY`.

[NOTE]
====
`Y` is random `[a-z0-9]` character
