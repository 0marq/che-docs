When starting a new project, new developers often loose time in finding the good procedure to build, run or debug a project. The result is documentation that are hard to follow and never up-to-date.

On boarding new developers is one of the main Che challenges. To help the new developers, lead developers can define devfiles to create on-demand workspaces for specific projects. 

In the devfile, lead developers can provide pre-defined commands to help the team to execute common build, run or debug tasks for the project.
