The Che-Theia IDE allows users to define custom commands in a devfile that are then available when working in a workspace.

This is useful, for example, for:

* Simplifying building, running, and debugging projects.
* Allowing lead developers to customize workspaces based on team requirements.
* Reducing time needed to onboard new team members.
