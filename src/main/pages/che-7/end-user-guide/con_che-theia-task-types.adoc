{prod-short} commands:: `Package Native App` and `Start Native App`
+
The {prod-short} commands are to be used to define tasks that will be executed in the workspace container.

* The `exec` type implies that the {prod-short} runner is used for command execution. The user can specify the component in whose container the command is executed.
* The `command` field contains the command line for execution.
* The `workdir` is the working directory in which the command is executed.
* The `component` field refers to the container where the command will be executed. The field contains the component `alias` where the container is defined.


VS Code launch configurations:: `Attach remote debugger`
+
VS Code launch configurations are most of the time used to defined debug configuration. These configurations could then be triggered when the developer hits `F5` or `Start Debugging` from the `Debug` menu. The configurations will give information to the debugger such as the port to connect for debugging or the type of application to debug (node, java, etc.).

* The type is `vscode-launch`.
* It contains the launch configurations in the VS Code format.
* For more information about VS Code launch configurations, see the Debugging section on the link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations[Visual Studio documentation page].


Tasks of type `che`, also known as `exec` commands, can be executed from the *Terminal->Run Task* menu or by clicking them in the *My Workspace* panel.
Other tasks are only available via *Terminal->Run Task*. Launch configurations are available in the Che-Theia debugger.
