= Converting a Visual Studio Code extension to a Che-Theia plug-in

This section describes how to install a link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode[VS Code extension] to an Eclipse Che workspace. The procedure uses the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode[SonarLint extension] as an example.

A VS Code extension can be bundled inside a Che-Theia plug-in. Che-Theia would not only contain the VS Code extension but also the container that would host the extension. The container would be predefined with all the needed dependencies to run the VS Code extension. For instance, the container for the Java VS Code extension would contain the right version of the JDK and also Maven or Gradle.

Learn how to create the container that will host our VS Code extension. It should be based on the `wsskeleton/theia-endpoint-runtime` image. This base image contains the runtime to launch VS Code extensions in sidecars. The container image will be built with all the necessary tools, software, and plug-in dependencies, including Java, Go, etc. The container image for our SonarLint plug-in looks like the following: link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-theia/blob/master/dockerfiles/remote-plugin-runner-java8/Dockerfile[remote-plugin-runner-java8/Dockerfile]. It is available from DockerHub: `garagatyi/remotetheia:java`.

A Che-Theia plug-in is defined by its `meta.yaml` configuration file. The file describes:

* IDE plug-in location (in our case, a VS Code extension identifier from the VS Code marketplace)
* container image that hosts the plug-in

// .Prerequisites
// 
// * A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts following this assembly.
// * You can also link to other modules or assemblies the user must follow before starting this assembly.
// * Delete the section title and bullets if the assembly has no prerequisites.


.Procedure

. Create the `meta.yaml` file for yout plug-in. The following is the `meta.yaml` file of the SonarLint Che-Theia plug-in (GitHub link: link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/blob/master/plugins/org.eclipse.che.vscode-sonarlint/0.0.1/meta.yaml[org.eclipse.che.vscode-sonarlint/0.0.1/meta.yaml]):

----
id: org.eclipse.che.vscode-sonarlint
version: 0.0.1
type: VS Code extension
name: vscode-sonarlint
title: Sonarlint code intelligence
description: VS Code extension that provides sonarlint features
icon: https://www.eclipse.org/che/images/logo-eclipseche.svg
attributes:
  extension: "vscode:extension/SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode"     <1>
  containerImage: "garagatyi/remotetheia:java"                   <2>
----
<1> The `extension` attribute consists of the `vscode:extension/` prefix and the VS Code extension ID, which can be retrieved from the extension details page at link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode[SonarLint extension].
<2> The `containerImage` attribute contains the container-image name in the form `<registry>/<org>/<repo>:<tag>`. This attribute is optional. Without it, the extension runs on the Che-Theia IDE container.

. Activate the Che-Theia plug-in in your Che workspace by adding its location to the workspace configuration:

.Che configuration with Che-Theia plug-in information
[source,json]
----
"attributes": {
  "editor": "org.eclipse.che.editor.theia:1.0.0",
  "plugins": "che-machine-exec-plugin:0.0.1,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/master/plugins/org.eclipse.che.vscode-sonarlint:0.0.1"
}
----
+
In this example, we activate two Che-Theia plug-ins: `che-machine-exec-plugin` and `SonarLint`. The plug-ins are referenced in different ways:
+
--
* The SonarLint plug-in is referenced by its location in a custom registry: `pass:[https://custom.registry.location.url:version]`. In this case, the registry location is: link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/master/plugins/org.eclipse.che.vscode-sonarlint[org.eclipse.che.vscode-sonarlint], and the version is `0.0.1`.
// I don't get this:
// It turns out that it would get the content directly from https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io/plugins/org.eclipse.che.vscode-sonarlint/0.0.1/meta.yaml[https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io/plugins/org.eclipse.che.vscode-sonarlint/0.0.1/meta.yaml]
* The Che-machine-exec plug-in is referenced by its ID defined in the default Che plug-in registry, which is located at link:https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io/plugins/[https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io/plugins/].
--

. Restart the workspace. You should see the logs listing the plug-ins being installed. We can see our Sonarlint Che-VSCode plugin.
