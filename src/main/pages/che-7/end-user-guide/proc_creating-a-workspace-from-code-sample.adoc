= Creating a workspace from code sample

This section describes how to select a workspace, then load a stack and its accompanying sample project.

It will also explain how to customize a workspace using the *Dashboard*.

[NOTE]
====
Every stack includes a sample codebase, which is defined by the devfile of the stack. For more information on devfiles, see link:{{site.baseurl}}che-7/configuring-a-workspace-using-a-devfile[Configuring a Che workspace using a devfile].
====

.Prerequisites

* You need an OKD (link:https://www.okd.io/minishift/[Minishift]), OCP, or OSD cluster, if using Che on Openshift.

* Or, you need a Kubernetes cluster such as link:https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation[Minikube] to use Che on Kubernetes.

* To install on Minishift or Minikube, see link:{{site.baseurl}}che-7/running-che-locally/#deploying-che-using-chectl[Deploying Che using chectl].

.Procedure

== Accessing the dashboard

The *Dashboard* is accessible on the cluster from a URL like `++http:/<che-instance>.<IP-address>.nip.io/dashboard/++`.

=== Minishift

See link:{{site.baseurl}}che-7/running-che-locally/#deploying-che-using-chectl[Deploying Che using chectl].

[NOTE]
====
For versions of link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases[Minishift up to 1.34], apply the following change:

----
$ oc set env dc/che CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__REGISTRY__URL=https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io/v3
----
====

. Log into your console at `++https://<IP-address>:8443/console/++`.

. Select the *mini-che* project:
+
* `++https://<IP-address>:8443/console/project/mini-che/overview++`

. Click through to the mini-che route link, which loads the *Dashboard* by default and prompts you to create a workspace.
+
* `++http://che-che.<IP-address>.nip.io/++`

==== OCP and OSD

For use on OCP or OSD, get the URL for the Che instance from the cluster administrator.

=== Selecting a stack

. When the *Dashboard* opens, click the link in the left navigation panel for *Workspaces*, if it is not already open.

. Choose a stack from the list.

. Name your workspace, or choose the default name.

=== Viewing the compute resource limits

The memory needed by the stack is pre-calculated and displayed on the stack description line. Changing the memory requirements is only possible xref:#configure-devfile[from the devfile].

=== Starting the workspace

There are two ways to start the workspace:

. Simple start: Click the btn:[Create & Open] button at the top or bottom of the form.
+

. Advanced start: From the top of the page, click the down arrow next to the btn:[Create & Open] button. Then, select the menu item below to edit the workspace configuration.
+
This allows the user to make further configuration before starting the workspace.

=== Changing the workspace configuration

If you chose the second option, you can configure the workspace's YAML configuration, among other tasks:

. From the *Overview* tab, rename a workspace, if you forgot to do that when creating it. Or, toggle the ephemeral mode, or export your workspace configuration to a file or private cloud. The user can also delete a workspace from here.

. From the *Projects* tab, add more projects to an existing workspace:
+

. From the *Plugins* tab, enable or disable workspace plug-ins. For example, start with a generic Java-based stack, then later add support for Node or Python.

. From the *Editors* tab, enable or disable workspace editors. For example, to switch to the Che 6 editor, select the GWT IDE. The Che 7 editor is based on Theia.

[start=5]
. From the *Devfile* tab, edit the workspace YAML configuration. Additionally, use th *Devfile* tab to:
+
** load a custom container that has been previously built and pushed to a container registry
** add commands and sample projects using source code
+

For example, to add a project into the workspace, add or edit the following section:

[source,yaml]
----
projects:
  - name: che
    source:
      type: git
      location: 'https://github.com/eclipse/che.git'
----

=== Running a workspace

There are multiple ways to run a workspace:

* By clicking the btn:[Run] button in the top-right corner of the workspace configuration page, which starts the workspace but does not switch to it.
* By clicking the btn:[Open] button in the top-right corner of the workspace configuration page, which starts the workspace and launches it in the browser.
* From the list of *Recent Workspaces* on the left navigation panel, right-click a non-running workspace to start it, or right-click a running workspace to stop it.
