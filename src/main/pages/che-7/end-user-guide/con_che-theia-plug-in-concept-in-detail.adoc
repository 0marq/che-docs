= {prod-short}-Theia plug-in concept in detail

{prod} provides a default web IDE for workspaces: {prod-short}-Theia. It is based on Eclipse Theia. It is a slightly different version than the plain Eclipse Theia one because there are functionalities that have been added based on the nature of the {prod} workspaces. This version of Eclipse Theia for {prod-short} is called *{prod-short}-Theia*.

You can extend the IDE provided with {prod} by building a *{prod-short}-Theia plug-in*. {prod-short}-Theia plug-ins are compatible with any other Eclipse Theia-based IDE.

== Client-side and server-side {prod-short}-Theia plug-ins

The {prod-short}-Theia editor plug-ins let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. Plug-ins run when the editor completes loading. If a {prod-short}-Theia plug-in fails, the main {prod-short}-Theia editor continues to work.

{prod-short}-Theia plug-ins run either on the client side or on the server side. This is a scheme of the client and server-side plug-in concept:

The same {prod-short}-Theia plug-in API is exposed to plug-ins running on the client side (Web Worker) or the server side (Node.js).


[id="{prod-id-short}-theia-plug-in-apis_{context}"]
== {prod-short}-Theia plug-in APIs

For the purpose of providing tool isolation and easy extensibility in {prod}, the {prod-short}-Theia IDE has a set of plug-in APIs. The APIs are compatible with Visual Studio Code extension APIs. In most cases, {prod-short}-Theia can run VS Code extensions as its own plug-ins.
// TODO: VS Code extensions as {prod-short}-Theia plug-ins. Read more at link:[LINK].

When developing a plug-in that depends on or interacts with components of {prod-short} workspaces (containers, preferences, factories), use the {prod-short} APIs embedded in {prod-short}-Theia.

== VS Code extensions and Eclipse Theia plug-ins

A {prod-short}-Theia plug-in can be based on a VS Code extension or an Eclipse Theia plug-in.

A Visual Studio Code extension:: To repackage a VS Code extension as a {prod-short}-Theia plug-in with its own set of dependencies, package the dependencies into a container. This ensures that {prod} users do not need to install the dependencies when using the extension. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/using-a-visual-studio-code-extension-in-che[Using a Visual Studio Code extension in {prod-short}].

An Eclipse Theia plug-in:: You can build a {prod-short}-Theia plug-in by implementing an Eclipse Theia plug-in and packaging it to {prod}.
// TODO: Learn more about how to package a {prod-short}-Theia plug-in at link:[LINK].
