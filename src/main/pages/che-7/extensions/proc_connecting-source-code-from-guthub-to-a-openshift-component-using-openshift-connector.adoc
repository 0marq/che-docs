= Connecting source code from GutHub to a OpenShift Component using OpenShift Connector

When you have Git-stored source code that you want to use for further development, it is more efficient to deploy it directly from the Git repo into the Openshift Connector Component.

.Prerequisites
* Have a running  {prod-short}workspace.
* Be logged in to the OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift Connector.

.Procedure

To make changes to your GitHub component, you need to clone the repository into {prod-short} to obtain this source code. To do so:

. In the {prod-short} main screen, open the *Command Palette* by pressing F1.
. Type the `Git Clone` command in the *Command Palette* and hit btn:[Enter].
. Provide the GitHub URL and select the destination for the deployment.
. Add source-code files to your Project by clicking the btn:[Add to workspace] button.
