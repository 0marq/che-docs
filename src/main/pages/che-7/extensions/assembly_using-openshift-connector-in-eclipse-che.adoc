= Using OpenShift Connector in {prod-short}

OpenShift Connector, also referred to as Visual Studio Code OpenShift Connector  for Red Hat OpenShift, is a plug-in for {prod-short} that provides a convenient and intuitive method for interacting with Red Hat OpenShift 3 or 4 clusters.

OpenShift Connector makes it possible to create, build, and debug applications in the {prod-short} IDE and then deploy the applications directly to the running OpenShift cluster.

OpenShift Connector acts as a GUI for the OpenShift Do (ODO) utility, which aggregates OpenShift CLI (OC) commands into compact units. As such, OpenShift Connector helps new developers who do not have OpenShift background with creating applications and running them on the cloud. Instead of using several `oc` commands, the user creates a new component or service by selecting a preconfigured template, such as a Project, an Application, or a Service; then and deploys it as an OpenShift Component to their cluste

This section provides information about installing, enabling, and basic use of OpenShift Connector plug-in in {prod-short}.
