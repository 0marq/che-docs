= Verifying the state of the NetcoredebugOutput plug-in

[discrete]
== Procedure

To test the Che-Theia plug-in initialization:

.  Check if there is a netcoredbg debug configuration in the
launch.json file. The following is an example debug configuration :
+
----
{
 "type": "netcoredbg",
 "request": "launch",
 "program": "$\{workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug/<target-framework>/<project-name.dll>",
 "args": [],
 "name": ".NET Core Launch (console)",
 "stopAtEntry": false,
 "console": "internalConsole"
}
----

.  To test if it exists, test the autocompletion feature within the
braces of the “configuration” section of the launch.json file. If you
can find netcoredbg, Che-Theia plug-in is correctly initialized. If not,
refer to the General tips.
