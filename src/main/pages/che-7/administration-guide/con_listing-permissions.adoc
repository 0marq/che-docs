[id="listing-permissions_{context}"]
= Listing permissions

To list the permissions that apply to a specific resource, perform the `GET /permissions` request.

The suitable domain values are:

* system

* organization

* workspace

*Note*: The domain is optional. If no domain is specified, the API returns all possible permissions for all the domains.
