Authorization of users in Che is based on the permissions model. Permissions are used to control the allowed actions of users and establish a security model. Each request is verified for the presence of the required permission in the current user subject after it passes authentication. You can control resources managed by Che and allow certain actions by assigning permissions to users.

Permissions can be applied to the following entities:

* Workspace

* Organization

* System
