= Viewing Che-Theia IDE logs on the command line

Observing Che-Theia IDE logs helps get a better understanding and insight over the plugins or other components' behavior. This section describes how to access the Che-Theia IDE logs and obtain their output using the OpenShift CLI.

.Prerequisites
* {prod-short} is deployed in a OpenShift cluster. This can validated by osbserving Openshift logs. See xref:viewing-the-state-of-the-{prod-id-short}-cluster-deployment-using-openshift-4-cli-tools_{context}[].
* A workspace is created.
* User is located in a {prod-short} installation namespace.
