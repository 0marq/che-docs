= Verifying the state of the Camel language server

[discrete]
== Procedure

The user can inspect the log output of the sidecar container running
the Camel tooling; the Camel tooling container is named:
“vscode-apache-camelxxx”.

To verify the state of the language server:

1.  Open a terminal inside the ‘vscode-apache-camelxxx’ container.
2.  Run the ‘ps aux | grep java’ command. The following is an example
language server process:

‘java -jar
/tmp/vscode-unpacked/camel-tooling.vscode-apache-camel.latest.euqhbmepxd.camel-tooling.vscode-apache-camel-0.0.14.vsix/extension/jars/language-server.jar’
