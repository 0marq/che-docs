[id="assigning-permissions_{context}"]
= Assigning permissions

To assign permissions to a resource, perform the `POST /permissions` request.
The suitable domain values are:

* system

* organization

* workspace

The following is a message body that requests permissions for a user with a userID to a workspace with a workspaceID:

```
{
  "actions": [
    "read",
    "use",
    "run",
    "configure",
    "setPermissions"
  ],
  "userId": "userID",
  "domainId": "workspace",
  "instanceId": "workspaceID"
}
```

The *instanceId* parameter corresponds to the ID of the resource that retrieves the permission for all the users. The *userId* parameter corresponds to the ID of the user that has been granted certain permissions.
