= Verifying the state of the YAML language server

[discrete]
== Procedure

Check if the container running the YAML plug-in is running the YAML
language server.

1.  In the editor, open a terminal in the container that is running the
YAML plug-in (an example name of the container: vscode-yaml-xxx).
2.  In the terminal run the `ps aux | grep node` command. This command
searches all the node processes running in the current container.
3.  Verify that a command `node ********/server.js` is running.

The `node ********/server.js` running in the container, indicates that
the language server is running. If it is not running, the language
server has not started inside the container. In this case, refer to
general tips.
