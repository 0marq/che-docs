= Verifying the state of the YAML language server

This section describes how to verify the state of the YAML language server.

[discrete]
== Procedure

Check if the container running the YAML plug-in is running the YAML language server.

. In the editor, open a terminal in the container that is running the YAML plug-in (an example name of the container: vscode-yaml-xxx).

. In the terminal run the `ps aux | grep node` command. This command searches all the node processes running in the current container.

. Verify that a command `node ********/server.js` is running.

The `node ********/server.js` running in the container, indicates that the language server is running. 
If it is not running, the language server has not started inside the container.
In this case, refer to general tips.
