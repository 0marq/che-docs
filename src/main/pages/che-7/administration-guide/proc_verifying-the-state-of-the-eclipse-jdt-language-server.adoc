= Verifying the state of the Eclipse JDT Language Server



[discrete]
== Procedure

Check if the container running the Eclipse JDT Language Server plug-in is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server main process.

. Open a terminal in the container that is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server plug-in (an example name for the container: vscode-javaxxx).

. Inside the terminal, run the ps aux | grep jdt command to check if the Eclipse JDT Language Server process is running in the container.
If the process is running, the output should be: usr/lib/jvm/default-jvm/bin/java --add-modules=ALL-SYSTEM --add-opens java.base/java.util. 
This message also shows the VSCode java extension used.
If it is not running, the language server has not been started inside the container. 
Check all logs described above in the General tips.
