This document covers all aspects of the authentication of users inside Eclipse Che both on the Che Server and inside the workspaces. This includes securing all the REST API endpoints, WebSocket/JSON RPC connections, and some web resources. Each of the authentication types uses the link:https://jwt.io/introduction/[JWT open standard] as a container for transferring user identity information. In addition, the Che server authentication is based on the link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] protocol implementation, which is provided by default by link:https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak]. Authentication on workspaces implies issuance of the self-signed per-workspace JWT tokens and their verification on the dedicated service based on link:https://www.keycloak.org/[JWTProxy].
