= Checking the YAML language server feature flags


[discrete]
== Procedure

To check the feature flags:

1.  Check if the features are enabled. The YAML plug-in provides
multiple settings that can enable and disable features such as:
+
* Yaml.format.enable: Enables the formatter
* yaml.validate: Enables validation
* yaml.hover: Enables the hover function
* yaml.completion: Enables the completion function


.  To check if the plug-in is working, type the simplest YAML such as
`hello: world` and then open the *Outline* panel on the right side of
the editor.

.  Verify if there are any document symbols. If yes, the language
server is connected to the editor.

.  If any feature is not working, make sure that the settings listed
above are set to `true` (they are set to `true` by default).

If a feature is not working, create an issue on the
