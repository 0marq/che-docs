= Authentication on the Che server using other authentication implementations

[discrete]
== Procedure

To adapt an OIDC authentication implementation, other than Keycloak:

. Update the authentication configuration parameters that are stored in the multiuser.properties file (such as client ID, authentication URL, realm name).

. Write a single filter or a chain of filters to validate tokens, create the user in the Che dashboard, and compose the subject object.

. If the new authorization provider supports the OpenID protocol, use the OIDC JS client library available at the settings endpoint since it is maximally decoupled of specific implementations.

. If the selected provider stores additional data about the user (first and last name, job title), it is recommended to write a provider-specific ProfileDao implementation that provides this information.
