== Procedure

To find the cluster where the workspace is running, query the OpenShift
API on che.openshift.io for user metadata and the URL of the OpenShift
cluster where the workspaces run. The following *curl* commands extract
this URL using *username* or *email* as a parameter, where *username* or
*email* are the credentials that the user used to log into
che.openshift.io:

curl -sgSL
"https://api.openshift.io/api/users?filter[username]=<username>" | jq -r
".data[0].attributes.cluster"

Or

curl -sgSL "https://api.openshift.io/api/users?filter[email]=<email>" |
jq -r ".data[0].attributes.cluster"

The output of the query is the OpenShift Online cluster URL (for
example:
https://api.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/[_https://api.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/_]).

After the user logs in to the Openshift Console and the underlying
cluster using the openshift.io login, the user gets read-only access to
the *<username>-che* namespace where all the workspace related pods are
created.
