= Uninstalling the Che instance after OperatorHub installation

Users have two options how to uninstall Che from an OpenShift cluster. The following sections describe both of these methods:

* Using the OpenShift Administrator Perspective web UI
* Using `oc` commands from the OpenShift console

== Uninstalling the Che instance after OperatorHub installation using the OpenShift Container Platform web UI

The OpenShift Container Platform web UI provides a quick way to uninstall Che. The following section describes how to uninstall Che from a cluster using the Openshift Administrator Perspective main menu.


.Prerequsities

* Che is installed on an OpenShift cluster using OperatorHub.

.Procedure

. Open the OpenShift web console.
. Navigate to the *Operators → Installed Operators* section.
. Click *Eclipse Che* in the list of installed operators.
. Navigate to the *Eclipse Che Cluster* tab.
. In the row that displays information about a specific Che cluster, delete the Che Cluster deployment using the icon:fa-ellipsis-v[] drop-down menu illustrated as two horizontal dots situated on the right side of the screen.

. Navigate again to the *Operators → Installed Operators* section in OpenShift Developer Perspective.
. In the row that displays information about a specific Eclipse Che Operator, uninstall the Che Operator using the icon:fa-ellipsis-v[] drop-down menu illustrated as two horizontal dots situated on the right side of the screen.

== Uninstalling the Che instance after OperatorHub installation using `oc` commands

To uninstall a Che instance, you can use `oc` commands instead of the Openshift Container Platform web UI. This section provides instructions to do so.

.Prerequisites

* Che was installed on an OpenShift cluster using OperatorHub.
* OpenShift command-line tools are installed on the local workstation.

.Procedure

The following procedure provides command line outputs as an example. Note that input in user terminal may differ.

To uninstall a Che instance from a cluster:

. Sign in to the cluster.
+
----
# oc login -u <yourLogin> -p <yourPassword> <clusterURL>
----

. Switch to the project where the Che instance is deployed.
+
----
# oc project <myProject>
----

. Obtain the Che cluster name. The following shows a cluster named `eclipse-che`.
+
----
# oc get checluster
NAME          AGE
eclipse-che   27m
----

. Delete the Che cluster.
+
----
# oc delete checluster eclipse-che
checluster.org.eclipse.che "eclipse-che" deleted
----

. Obtain the name of the Che cluster service version (CSV) module. The following detects a CSV module named `eclipse-che.v7.4.0`.
+
----
# oc get csv
NAME                 DISPLAY       VERSION   REPLACES             PHASE
eclipse-che.v7.4.0   Eclipse Che   7.4.0     eclipse-che.v7.3.1   Succeeded
----

. Delete the Che CSV.
+
----
# oc delete csv eclipse-che.v7.4.0
clusterserviceversion.operators.coreos.com "eclipse-che.v7.4.0" deleted
----
