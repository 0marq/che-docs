= Viewing Camel logs in the Output panel

The Camel language server is a Springboot application that writes its
log to the `$\{java.io.tmpdir}/log-camel-lsp.out` file. Typically,
$\{java.io.tmpdir} points to the ` /tmp` directory, so the filename is
`/tmp/log-camel-lsp.out`.


[discrete]
== Procedure

* The Camel language server logs are printed in the Output channel named
“Language Support for Apache Camel”. 
[Note]
====
The output channel is created only at the first created log entry on the client side. It may be absent when everything is going well.
