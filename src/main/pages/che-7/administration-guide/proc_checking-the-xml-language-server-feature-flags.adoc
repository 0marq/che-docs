= Checking the XML language server feature flags

[discrete]
== Procedure

.  Check if the features are enabled. The XML plug-in provides multiple
settings that can enable and disable features:
+
*  Xml.format.enabled: Enable the formatter
* Xml.validation.enabled: Enable the validation
* xml.documentSymbols.enabled: Enable the document symbols


.  To diagnose if the XML language server is working, create a simple
XML element such as `<hello></hello>` and confirm that it appears in the
*Outline* panel on the right.

.  If the document symbols do not show, ensure that the
`xml.documentSymbols.enabled` attribute is set to `true`. If it is
`true`, and there are no symbols, the language server may not be hooked
to the editor. However, if there are document symbols then the language
server is connected to the editor.

.  Ensure that the features that the user needs, are set to `true` in
the settings (they are set to `true` by default). If any of the features
are not working, or not working as expected, create an issue on the
https://github.com/angelozerr/lsp4xml[_Language Server_].
