= OpenShift Developer Perspective integration with Che

The following section provides information about OpenShift Developer Perspective support with Che, which is available since Che 7.2.

When Che Operator is installed into an Openshift Container Platform 4.2 and later, it creates a ConsoleLink Custom Resource (CR). This adds an interactive link to the *Red Hat Applications* menu that you can use to access a Che installation using the OpenShift Developer Perspective console. The *Red Hat Applications* menu can be accessed in the main screen of an OpenShift Container Platform, illustrated with a three by three cube. The Che ConsoleLink, displayed in the drop-down menu, creates a new workspace or redirects the user to an existing one.

A secondary mention of OpenShift Developer Perspective features is an ability for a user to use Che for editing application source code in native Che workspaces.

* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the concept module.
* Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
* For more details on writing concept modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles. For tips, see _Anchor Names and File Names_ in link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
