= Finding {prod-short} cluster URL using the OpenShift 4 CLI

This section describes how to obtain the {prod-short} cluster URL using the OpenShift 4 CLI (command line interface). The URL can be retrieved from the OpenShift logs or from the `checluster` Customer Resource.

.Prerequisites
* {prod-short} is deployed in a OpenShift cluster. This can be validated by osbserving Openshift logs. See xref:viewing-the-state-of-the-{prod-id-short}-cluster-deployment-using-openshift-4-cli-tools_{context}[].
* User is located in a {prod-short} installation namespace.

.Procedure

. For retrieving a {prod-short} cluster URL from the `checluster` CR, run the following command:
+
[options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ oc get checluster --output jsonpath='{.items[0].status.cheURL}'
----

. The {prod-short} cluster URL is displayed.
+
Alternatively, wait for the logs to show the message `{prod} is now available at:` followed by the {prod-short} cluster URL:
+
[subs="+attributes",options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
include::examples/{project-context}-cluster-url-logs.log[]
----
+
After the deployment is finished, click the {prod-short} cluster URL in the log output or use the following command to filter it out:
+
[options="nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ oc logs --tail=10 `oc get pods --output name | grep operator` | grep "available at" | awk -F'available at: ' '{print $2}' | sed 's/"//'
----
