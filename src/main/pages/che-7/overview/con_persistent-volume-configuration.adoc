= Persistent volume configuration

A Kubernetes persistent volume is attached to the {prod-short} workspace to persist its data: source code, application logs, and tools configuration. A {prod-short} server can be configured to use different strategies:

* *common*: A {prod-short} workspace that is provisioned in the same Kubernetes namespace and shares the same `PersistentVolume`. The data of different workspaces are separated using subpaths. The default strategy is *common*.

* *unique*: Every {prod-short} workspace is attached to a distinct persistent volume. This strategy provides better data isolation but requires more resources.
