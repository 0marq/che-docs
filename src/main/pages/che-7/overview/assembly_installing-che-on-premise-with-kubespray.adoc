This article explains how to create a single or multi-node bare metal Kubernetes cluster to deploy {prod-short}.

A bare metal cluster has multiple advantages (performance, density, etc.) but also drawbacks (longer to reset, etc.). An other type of installation is inside Virtual Machines for example. 

There are a lot of ways to deploy a bare metal cluster, we will use Kubespray in this article for its simplicity.

== Configuration

Hardware:

* CPU: 2 preferable (no check performed by Kubespray)
* RAM: 1024MB/1500MB minimum for worker/master nodes enforced in Kubespray (configurable)

[NOTE]
====
{prod} requires minimum CPU and RAM to run itself and to spawn user environments
====

Software:

* O/S: link:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray#supported-linux-distributions[check the supported distributions]
* Kubespray: 2.12.5
* Python: 3.7
* Helm: 3.1.2
