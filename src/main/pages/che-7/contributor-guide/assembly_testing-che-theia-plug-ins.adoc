= Testing {prod-short}-Theia plug-ins

:context: testing-che-theia-plug-ins

Developers can test how plug-ins work while working on them by running {prod-short}-Theia in the hosted mode. It is a special mode in which {prod-short}-Theia loads your plug-in directly from the `/projects` directory (as opposed to the rest of the plug-ins, which are loaded from the plug-in registry). The {prod-short}-Theia hosted mode is similar to the debug mode in VS Code.

== Starting a hosted {prod-short}-Theia instance

. Press F1 to display the command palette, and run the `Hosted Plugin: Start Instance` command.

. Specify the path to the plug-in. A new browser tab is opened.

.Status in the hosted instance

When running in the hosted mode, {prod-short}-Theia displays a *Development Host* message in the status bar. When you hover your mouse over the message, a tip is displayed with the name of the hosted plug-in.

.Status in the main instance
At the same time, the main instance of {prod-short}-Theia displays a *Hosted Plugin* message in the status bar. This element indicates the state of the hosted instance. After starting the hosted instance, main {prod-short}-Theia begins to watch the code changes.

When you change something in your plug-in, you can switch to the hosted {prod-short}-Theia instance, refresh the page, and immediately see the results.

.Plug-in output

When you run a hosted instance, the main {prod-short}-Theia instance opens the *Output* view. This view contains all the output from the `yarn` backend process. It also contains the output of the backend plug-in that is being developed.

== Controlling a hosted {prod-short}-Theia instance

You can control the state of the hosted instance directly from the main instance. Click *Hosted Plugin* element in the status bar, and a context menu with the available actions is displayed. You can stop and restart the running hosted {prod-short}-Theia instance from the context menu. When a hosted instance is stopped, use the context menu to start it again.

== Using code completion

There is a full code completion provided to help you write your plug-in. Code completion covers both the {prod-short}-Theia plug-in API and the {prod-short} plug-in API.

.Code-completion example
[example]
====
Your plug-in will handle the opening of a document and displaying a notification message when the document is opened.
