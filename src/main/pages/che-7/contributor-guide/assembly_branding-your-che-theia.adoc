:context: branding-your-che-theia

As a user you may be interested in customizing your Che-Theia to be consistent with your product. You can easily change the name of the product, logo and description that are displayed in Welcome page and in About dialog. Also you can customize the list of helpful resources that are displayed in Help section in the Welcome page.

Since Che-Theia is running in a separate `eclipse/che-theia` container, you need to:

* Build container image with your Che-Theia.
* Define an editor meta.yaml which uses your custom image.
* Create a workspace from a devfile with your editor.

To build container image with your Che-Theia you need to do following steps:

* Create JSON file with product information.
* Prepare two images with logo of your product for dark and light themes.
* Build a Che-Theia container image containing sample product JSON.

== Create JSON file with product information

The first you have to create a `product.json` file containing the name of the product, logo, description, list of hyperlinks to be shown in the welcome page and place it somewhere on the file system.

An example of `https://github.com/che-samples/che-theia-branding-example/blob/master/branding/product.json[product.json]`:

----
{
    "name": "Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces",
    "icon": "codeready-workspaces-icon.png",
    "logo": {
        "dark": "codeready-workspaces-logo-light.png",
        "light": "codeready-workspaces-logo-dark.png"
    },
    "welcome": {
        "title": "Welcome to Your Workspace",
        "links": ["website", "documentation"]
    },
    "links": {
        "website": {
            "name": "Discover CodeReady Workspaces",
            "url": "https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview"
        },
        "documentation": {
            "name": "Browse Documentation",
            "url": "https://www.redhat.com/docs"
        }
    }
}
----

In this file:

* *name*: the name of the product. It will be used as tab title for welcome page, and as a title for about dialog.
* *icon*: small logo of your product. Is used as an icon for welcome page tab title.
* *logo*: two logo images of you product for dark and light themes. Logo is shown in the Welcome page and in the about dialog. This property can refer on the images relative to your `product.json` file. You can also use absolute path or http resource.
It's possible simplify the conficuration and use one logo image for both dark and light themes:
+
----
{
    ...
    "logo": "your-product-logo.png"
    ...
}
----
* *welcome*: this section is optional. It describes the behavior of welcome page.
For welcome page you can set the invitation title and pick the links which will be shown inside `Help` section.
In this example both links to the website and to the documentation will be shown. If you omit `welcome/links` property, the Welcome page will display all the links, that are described in the `links` section.
* *links*: list of helpful resources for you product. For future expanding, each link is tagged (e.g. website, documentation). This gives the ability to find the appropriate link by tag name.


== Prepare two images with logo of your product for dark and light themes

The next step is to prepare product logo. It's better to have two dedicates images for dark and light themes.
Image should have your product icon and name which are placed on the transparent background. You have to save the image in any format which you prefer and which is supported by your browser.
Place images next to your `product.json` file and specify them in corresponsing JSON propertires.

If you prefer to use http resources, you can easily do it like following
----
{
    ...
    "logo": {
        "dark": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/che-samples/che-theia-branding-example/master/branding/codeready-workspaces-logo-light.png",
        "light": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/che-samples/che-theia-branding-example/master/branding/codeready-workspaces-logo-dark.png"
    }
    ...
}
----

Please note, that the maximum height of logo is 80 pixels for Welcome page and 100 pixels for About dialog.
Don't use wery wide logo to not broke the design.

== Build a Che-Theia container image containing sample product JSON

Below is an example of the `https://github.com/che-samples/che-theia-branding-example/blob/master/Dockerfile[Dockerfile]` to build a container with your Che-Theia.

----
FROM eclipse/che-theia:next

COPY branding ${HOME}/branding

ENV PRODUCT_JSON=${HOME}/branding/product.json
----

Create `Dockerfile` somewhere on the file system.
Then create `branding` directory next to the `Dockerfile` and move your `product.json` and logo images inside this directory.
Now you can build the container image with your Che-Theia by running `$ docker build` command and then push the image to the dockerhub using `$ docker push`.

----
$ docker build -t username/che-theia-codeready-workspaces:next .
$ docker push username/che-theia-codeready-workspaces:next
----

== Define an editor meta.yaml which uses your custom image

The easiest way to test your Che-Theia is to create a new `meta.yaml` describing custom `Che Editor` and use it in your devfile.

It's better to pick the latest Che-Theia `meta.yaml` from https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/tree/master/v3/plugins/eclipse/che-theia[plugin registry] and replace `image` inside `containers` section.

== Create a workspace from a devfile with your editor

Create a workspace from the https://github.com/che-samples/che-theia-branding-example/blob/master/devfile.yaml[devfile] to see the result:

image::https://che.openshift.io/factory/resources/factory-contribute.svg[link="https://che.openshift.io/f?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/che-samples/che-theia-branding-example/master/devfile.yaml"]

----
metadata:
  name: che-theia-all
projects:
  - name: che-cheia-branding-example
    source:
      location: 'https://github.com/che-samples/che-theia-branding-example.git'
      type: git
      branch: master
components:
  - type: cheEditor
    reference: >-
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/che-samples/che-theia-branding-example/master/che-editor.meta.yaml
apiVersion: 1.0.0
----

After running the workspace you Che-Theia will look like following:

image::branding/welcome-dark.png[link="{imagesdir}/branding/welcome-dark.png"]

image::branding/about-dark.png[link="{imagesdir}/branding/about-dark.png"]

Everything should look fine when switching to light theme.

image::branding/welcome-light.png[link="{imagesdir}/branding/welcome-light.png"]

image::branding/about-light.png[link="{imagesdir}/branding/about-light.png"]
