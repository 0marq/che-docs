= Che configMaps and their behavior

The following section describes Che `configMaps` and how they behave.

A link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/builds/setting-up-trusted-ca.html[`configMap`] is provided as an editable file that lists options to customize the Che environment. Based on the Che installation method, `configMaps` can be used to customize the working environment. The type of configMaps available in your Che environment varies based on the method used for installing Che.

== Che installed using the Operator

link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/applications/operators/olm-what-operators-are.html[Operators] are software extensions to Kubernetes that use link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/applications/crds/crd-managing-resources-from-crds.html[custom resources] to manage applications and their components.

When Che is installed using the Operator, this installation provides the user with two automatically generated `configMaps`: `che` (main) and `custom` (additional).

* The `che` `configMap` contains the main properties for the installation and is in sync with the information stored in the CheCluster Custom Resource file. If the user edits the `che` `configMap` after installing Che from the Operator, those changes are automatically overwritten by the values that the Operator obtains from the CheCluster Custom Resource.
To edit the `che` `configMap`, edit the Custom Resource manually.
The `configMap` derives values from the CheCluster field. If a user changes the CheCluster Custom Resource field, the Operator changes the attributes of the `che` `configMap` accordingly. Those `configMap` changes automatically trigger a restart of the Che pod.

* The secondary `custom` `configMap` is for additional properties customization that the user can edit manually. These properties include environment variables that are not already specified in the main che `configMap`. To apply the manual changes to the `custom` `configMap`, delete the Che pod to manually restart it.

== Che installed using a Helm Chart:

A (https://helm.sh/)[Helm Chart] is the Kubernetes extension for defining, installing, and upgrading Kubernetes applications.

* When Che is installed using a Helm Chart, the user configures Che manually by modifying the `configMap` object. The `configMap` object is called `che` and is generated as an editable template after the installation. To apply the manual changes to the `custom` `configMap`, delete the Che pod to manually restart it.
Alternatively, use the following command in the kubectl command-line interface:
+
----
$ kubectl rollout restart deployment/che
----
+
This avoids the downtime associated with deleting a pod, as it deploys and starts a new pod, and only then deletes the old pod.
