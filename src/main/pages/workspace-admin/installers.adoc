[id="what-are-installers"]
== What are installers?

Installers are scripts that are injected into machines in a runtime and get executed there to:

1.  Prepare the environment and download dependencies for a particular software or tool
2.  Install chosen software and dependencies
3.  Launch software and tools in a certain way (arguments, mode etc) that provide extra functionality for a workspace

Installers are typically language servers and tools that provide features such as SSH access to a workspace machine. You can find a complete list of available installers in the *Workspace details > Installers* tab.

The following is an example of installers:

"installers": [
    "org.eclipse.che.exec",
    "org.eclipse.che.terminal",
    "org.eclipse.che.ws-agent",
    "org.eclipse.che.ssh"
        ]

[id="how-installers-work"]
== How installers work?

Installers are saved in a configuration file that a link:what-are-workspaces.html#bootstrapper[bootstrapper] uses to execute jobs. An installer script is a shell script that works exactly the same way it works in your local Linux environment. Che server checks if the process that an installer has launched is alive.

There are installers that activate special agents such as the workspace agent, terminal, and exec agent. For example, if a workspace agent fails to start, the workspace will be considered as started but the IDE will not be usable. Exec agent failure will result in unavailability of commands widget.

[id="enable-and-disable-installers"]
== Enabling and disabling installers

Installers can be enabled or disabled in the *User Dashboard* per machine, or directly in the workspace machine configuration. When an installer is enabled, bootstrapper executes an installer script after the workspace has started.

[id="installers-failures"]
== Installers failures

Installers expect that a user that is listed in the `sudoers` file can have privileges. Installers can fail due to the `permission denied` error even when a user is listed in the `sudoers` file. 
On OpenShift, where a pod is run by an arbitrary user with no permissions to use sudo, and/or access/modify resources on the file system. 

In most cases, though, this problem can be solved by rebuilding the base image so that it already has all of the dependencies for a particular agents that an installer activates. 

Another possible issue might be with permissions to files and folders. For example, an installer may need to write to https://github.com/eclipse/che-dockerfiles/blob/master/recipes/stack-base/centos/Dockerfile#L45-L57[user home directory].

== Installer registry and REST API

Che installers are stored at Installer Registry. They can be viewed and edited through the Installer Registry REST API:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Path | HTTP Method | Description
|/installer |GET | Get installers
|/installer/{id}/version |GET | Get versions of installers by given id
|/installer/orders |GET | Get installers, ordered by their dependencies
|/installer/ |POST | Add installer to the registry
|/installer/{key} |PUT | Update installer in the registry
|`/installer/{key}` |DELETE | Remove installer from the registry
|===
